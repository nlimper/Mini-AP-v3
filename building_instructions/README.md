# Building instructions

If you get the kit, you will receive:

#### **Kit:**

- 3D-printed case (SLA, professionally resin printed)
- PCB, with SMD-components already mounted
- ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 module (16 MB flash, 8 MB psram)
- ESP32-C6-WROOM-1 module (4 MB flash)
- 1.47" TFT screen
- WS2812B LED and 3x 0603 SMD Led.

To build it, you need to mount the ESP32-S3 and -C6 module, the TFT, and the leds. You need some soldering experience to do this. You can solder them by hand, but you need a good soldering iron with a very fine tip and steady hands. The 0603 components are really tiny. If you're not sure if you're able to handle the tiny parts in the kit, it's better to order this assembled version. After building, You'll need to program the ESP32-S3 and the ESP32-C6 using the [OpenEPaperLink Web Flasher](https://openepaperlink.de/) or PlatformIO.
The Access Point is powered by USB-C cable (not included)
